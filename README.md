# advent-of-code-2022

A repository for my solutions to the Advent of Code for 2022!

I'm writing my solutions in Go to get a better feel for the language and solving problems with it.

## Info

- each day will have a folder corresponding to the day
- To compile, each folder will need a corresponding `input.txt` file for the given day. You can retrieve the input for each day at `https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/<day_number>/input`
- code can be run by executing `go run main.go --part (1/2)` from inside each day's folder for the corresponding part
- the result will be printed out as:
